Here\u2019s to the misfits and the rebels, the rule-breakers, the square pegs in the round holes, the ones who see things differently. Bohemiana is a collection that\u2019s just as unique as you. Channel your inner bohemian self with a furniture line that\u2019s part industrial, part distressed and 100% avant garde.\nContemporary is very current and in trend, of the here and now. It\u2019s a very fluid, simplistic style which takes its cues from the in-vogue polishes, textures and colors of the season and is bereft of any ornamentation or embellishments.\nA Bench is a long seat on which multiple people may sit at the same time. Benches are typically made of wood, but may also be made of metal, stone, or synthetic materials. Benches typically have no back rest and can be sat on from either side.", "Item Price": "Rs.19,999", "Savings": "Rs.8,656 (38% Off)", "Details": {"Brand: ": "Bohemiana", "Dimensions:": "H 18.5 x W 35.5 x D 12 (All Dimensions in Inches)", "Weight:": "6.95 KG", "Primary Material:": "Fabric", "Room Type:": "Living Room", "Height:": "18.5 inches", "Width:": "35.5 inches", "Depth:": "12.0 inches", "Seating Height:": "17"}}
