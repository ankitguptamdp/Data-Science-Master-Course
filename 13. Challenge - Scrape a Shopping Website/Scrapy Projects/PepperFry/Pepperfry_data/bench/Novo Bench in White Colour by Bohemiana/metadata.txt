Here's to the misfits and the rebels, the rule-breakers, the square pegs in the round holes, the ones who see things differently. Bohemiana is a collection thats just as unique as you. Channel your inner bohemian self with a furniture line thats part industrial, part distressed and 100% avant garde.\nIndustrial Style depicts a raw, unfinished, earthy and elemental look. As the name implies, it draws inspiration from warehouses and urban lofts its a style which celebrates contrasts. Its coming together of opposing materials to create a cohesive format. Its a fusion of old with the new, the bold with muted colours, the shiny with distressed finish, the knotty with the even tones, the solids with the patterned fabrics, or the functional with the outlandish.\nA Bench is a long seat on which multiple people may sit at the same time. Benches are typically made of wood, but may also be made of metal, stone, or synthetic materials. Benches typically have no back rest and can be sat on from either side.", "Item Price": "Rs.13,124", "Savings": "Rs.7,219 (44% Off)", "Details": {"Brand: ": "Bohemiana", "Dimensions:": "H 18 x W 46 x D 16", "Weight:": "16.05 KG", "Colour:": "White", "Primary Material:": "Metal", "Room Type:": "Dining Room", "Collection:": "White Room", "Height:": "18.0 inches", "Width:": "46.0 inches", "Depth:": "16.0 inches", "Seating Height:": "18"}}
