{"Item Title": "Rafael Bench in Provincial Teak Finish by Bohemiana", "Description": "Bohemiana is rhapsody for your home. Here\u009ds to the misfits and the rebels, the rule-breakers, the square pegs in the round holes, the ones who see things differently. Bohemiana is a collection that\u009ds just as unique as you. Channel your inner bohemian self with a furniture line that\u009ds part industrial, part distressed and 100% avant garde.\nIndustrial \u009d is a raw, unfinished, earthy and elemental look. As the name implies it draws inspiration from warehouses and urban lofts, \u009d it\u009ds a style which celebrates contrasts. It\u009ds not the \u009dmatchy matchy\u009d kind of look, but a coming together of opposing materials to create a cohesive format. It\u009ds a fusion of old with the new, the bold with muted colours, the shiny with distressed finish, the knotty with the even tones, the solids with the patterned fabrics, or the functional with the outlandish.\nA Bench is a long seat on which multiple people may sit at the same time. Benches are typically made of wood, but may also be made of metal, stone, or synthetic materials. Benches typically have no back rest and can be sat on from either side.", "Item Price": "Rs.19,374", "Savings": "Rs.6,750 (33% Off)", "Details": {"Brand: ": "Bohemiana", "Dimensions:": "H 18 x W 52 x D 18 (all dimensions in inches)", "Weight:": "15 KG", "Primary Material:": "Sheesham Wood", "Room Type:": "Living Room", "Height:": "18.0 inches", "Width:": "52.0 inches", "Depth:": "18.0 inches", "Seating Height:": "18"}}
